# DSD2ImageProcessing
Image processing done in VHDL, Does contrast stretching and noise reduction


Noise reduction uses median filtering in a 3x3 and 5x5 window. 

Contrast Stretching takes the lowest and highest 3% of the pixels in the image and sets them to the minimum and maximum values in the image.

This was done in the spring of 2014
